# Several improvements can be made:

- [X] Turn off the bold and italic setting for the user (Do this by creating a new paragraph?)
- [ ] Make something to open just to read document. Everytime it opens it will create a new date. (Search doc for todays date?)
- [X] Put button display for documents in chronological order
- [ ] Fix tkinter scaling issue

# Remember to update the path to the .exe and pics once the GUI code is finished
