# Several improvements can be made:

- [X] Turn off the bold and italic setting for the user (Do this by creating a new paragraph?)
- [X] Make something to open just to read document. Everytime it opens it will create a new date. (Search doc for todays date?)
- [X] Put button display for documents in chronological order
- [ ] Fix tkinter scaling issue
- [X] Add scroll bar for month document buttons
- [X] Sort month document buttons
- [ ] Add an exploration feature. When you close a document, keep the scroller open to look at others
- [ ] Add a book mark feature. Create a color on a document indicating which month you were reading and make it open at the page you were reading at. How would I do this?
- [ ] Could I implement some kind of search through all of the documents? What about NLP?
- [ ] Maybe add time stamp along with the date?
- [ ] Add a prompt asking if we want to make an entry?

# Beyond
- [ ] Create my own writing app instead of using Microsoft Word
- [ ] In the writing app, make a boxed theme surrounding text that indicates what is about to be written is important. This thought can be expanded
