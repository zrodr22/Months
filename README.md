Several improvements can be made:

- [X] Turn off the bold and italic setting for the user (Do this by creating a new paragraph?)
- [ ] Make something to open just to read document. Everytime it opens it will create a new date. (Search doc for todays date?)
- [ ] 

pyinstaller script.py --icon=c:\path-to\icon.ico
